    "description": "Split It is a Flutter-based budget-splitting app built to simplify managing shared expenses within a group. It allows users to create \"splits\" for various group activities, add contributors, and record transactions to track who paid, how much, and for what purpose. The app also offers a smart settlement feature, which calculates and displays the exact transactions needed to equalize the groupâ€™s expenses, making it easy to settle bills.\n\nOn the technical side, Split It is a Flutter app that uses the Isar database for offline-first data management, ensuring that users can create and manage splits without the need for an internet connection. The database structure efficiently stores splits, contributors, and transaction data in a way that is easy to retrieve and update. No authentication or account setup is required, making it privacy-focused and simple to use.",

    "description": "Memchess is a 2 player online game that combines memory and chess. It consists of a memory board and a chess board, both played simultaneously. The memory tiles represent pieces on the chess board and have a direct link to them. Matching a pair will delete the corresponding piece from the chess board and capturing a piece will remove it's tiles from the memory board.This unique combination allows for new strategies and plays that are not possible in traditional chess. \n\n This project is  separed into a client and server. The client is made in TypeScript and React, using libraries like Tailwind CSS and Daisy UI for styling and chess.js and SocketIO for fucntionality. The server is a Rust Axum server, deployed via Shuttle that control the SocketIO server and server-side valdation for the game. The UI is fully responsive and also features a dark mode."

The game features a wave based system where the player has to defend their base from incoming slimes. The player can place towers on the map to attack the slimes and earn money to buy more towers. The game has simple controls and allows the user to directly take control of the placed towers for more interactivity. It also features a high score system and a shop to buy towers. The game is available for download on itch.io. I also did the art and sound design for this game, all assets used are made by us."
